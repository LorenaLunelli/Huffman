# Huffman Algorithm
by Lorena Lunelli
___

<h3> Description </h3>

This is an implementation of the Huffman algorithm for compression.
The main goal is to generate non-fixed codes for the characters of a given text, and then "compress" it.
For a better visualization, the compression is not real. Instead, I write '0's and '1's in a string to emulate how the compression would happen.
___

<h3> Compile</h3>

To build the project, the command javac has to be called outside the huffman/ folder.

> javac huffman/*.java
___

<h3> Run</h3>

To run, you have to call the main class, along with a .txt file as a parameter.

> java huffman.Huffman Tabacaria.txt
___

<h3> Results</h3>

The results of this program are:

a. A terminal output, with the values of the compression.
	
b. A file with the string that emulates the final compression.
